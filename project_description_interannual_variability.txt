This file contains documentation for archived code and data for 'Observed Changes in Interannual Precipitation
Variability in the United States' by Ryan D. Harp and Daniel E. Horton (submitted to Geophysical Research Letters on
June 18th, 2022). The following guide will detail the origin (whether downloaded or created) and purpose of files
necessary to successfully recreate our analysis.


Files downloaded and their initial location:
- NEON domain shapefiles: https://www.neonscience.org/data-samples/data/spatial-data-maps (under Quick Downloads >
    Domain Polygons)
- GHCN station data and metadata: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily
- NCA region shapefiles: personal communication with NCA authors

Scripts and their inputs/outputs:
- ghcn_summarizer.py: this script loops through all stations listed in the ghcnd-stations.txt summary file and
    compiles summary statistics and metadata on each station.
    - input:
        ghcnd-stations.txt (downloaded from GHCN portal)
        ghcnd-stations_file_compare.csv (manually created by comparing available file list with list of stations in
            metadata)
        all available GHCN-D station csv files (downloaded from GHCN portal)
    - output:
        ghcn_summary.csv: list of all available stations and relevant metadata and summary statistics
- station_NEON_assignment.py: this script loops through all stations in the summary/metadata file and determines which
    NEON domain each station falls within.
    - input:
        ghcn_summary.csv (created by ghcn_summarizer.py)
        NEON_Domains.shp (NEON domain shapefiles downloaded from neonscience.org)
    - output:
        US_stations_with_NEON.csv: list of all available stations within the US and relevant metadata/summary
            statistics, including NEON domain
- station_NCA_assignment.py: this script loops through all stations in the summary/metadata file and determines which
    NEON domain each station falls within.
    - input:
        ghcn_summary.csv (created by ghcn_summarizer.py)
        cb_2020_us_state_500k_ncaregions.shp (NCA region shapefiles from personal communication with NCA authors)
    - output:
        US_stations_with_NCA.csv: list of all available stations within the US and relevant metadata/summary
            statistics, including NCA region
- interannual_variability_stats.py: this script calculates trends and baselines in annual precipitation, precipitation
    frequency, interannual variability, and relative interannual variability for each domain
    - input:
        all available GHCN-D station csv files (downloaded from GHCN portal)
        US_stations_with_NEON.csv (created by station_NEON_assignment.py)
    - output:
        NEON_domain_precip_stats_start_year_*_window_length_*_domain_*.csv: domain-specific results for trends and
            and baselines that are manually combined into a merged file
- interannual_variability_stats_NCA.py: this script calculates trends and baselines in annual precipitation,
    precipitation frequency, interannual variability, and relative interannual variability for each domain
    - input:
        all available GHCN-D station csv files (downloaded from GHCN portal)
        US_stations_with_NCA.csv (created by station_NEON_assignment.py)
    - output:
        NCA_region_precip_stats_start_year_*_window_length_*_domain_*.csv: domain-specific results for trends and
            and baselines that are manually combined into a merged file
- precipitation_variability_plots.py: this script produces all figures for article
    - input:
        NEON_Domains.shp (NEON domain shapefiles downloaded from neonscience.org)
        cb_2020_us_state_500k_ncaregions.shp (NCA region shapefiles from personal communication with NCA authors)
        NEON_domain_precip_stats_start_year_1970_window_length_11_domain__merged.csv
            (created manually from results of *** daily_precip_block_bootstrap_calculations_NEON.py)
        NCA_domain_precip_stats_start_year_1970_window_length_11_region__merged.csv
            (created manually from results of *** daily_precip_block_bootstrap_calculations_NEON.py)
        NEON_domain_precip_stats_start_year_1950_window_length_11_domain__merged.csv
            (created manually from results of *** daily_precip_block_bootstrap_calculations_NEON.py)
